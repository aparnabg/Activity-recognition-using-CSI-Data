# Activity recognition using CSI Data
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of activity recognition in CSI (Channel State Information) Data using various machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we explore the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and KNN algorithms.
